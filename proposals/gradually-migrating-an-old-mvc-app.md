# "Big Bang" Theory vs "Gradual Migration" Reality
## Gradually Migrating an old ASP.NET MVC App

Most developers deal with legacy code regularly. And more often than not, 
there are plans for a "big bang" rewrite. But in most cases, the plan stays a plan for a long time. 
"It's cheaper to fix this bug/add this feature in the old codebase. We will do the rewrite later" is the sentence we all know too good.

But there is a way to gradually migrate your legacy MVC apps to a modern architecture. 
All you need is an easy-to-use frontend framework like Vue.js and a flexible and supportive IDE like Jetbrains Rider.

In this talk, we will see how you can migrate your old ASP.NET MVC app to a modern architecture without your customers noticing anything. 
The target architecture will be a Vue.js-based single-page application and a lightweight .NET 5 Web API.
