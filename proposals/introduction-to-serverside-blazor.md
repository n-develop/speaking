# Server-Side Blazor in Action

Not everybody loves JavaScript. There, I said it. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate JavaScript. But I love C#.
I always dreamed about writing my frontend code in C#. Tell you what? It's possible. Even without WebAssembly.

In this talk, we will dive into the the world of server-side blazor. After a short walk through the default project template,
we will create a custom component. Doing this, the attendees will learn about data binding, see how pages interact with components, 
and explore what to do, if we need to interoperate with JavaScript.
There are only a few slides used for the introduction. The rest of the time will be spent in the code to see server-side Blazor development in action. 

This talk is rated level 200 - 300 with a target audience of software developers.

It is assumed, that you have basic knowledge of software development with ASP.NET Core.
The code is written in C# and should be accessible to most programmers.
