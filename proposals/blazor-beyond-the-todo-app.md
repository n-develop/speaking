# Blazor: Beyond the ToDo App

There are a lot of great tutorials out there to get started with Blazor. And they all help developers get into Blazor. But not every application is a simple ToDo app. In todays enterprise applications we rarely write all the code in a single ASP.NET Core project. 

In this talk, we will go beyond the popular ToDo app example. We will create a small app that separates the API and the UI in different projects. This lays the foundation for more complex applications. We will also use "Project Tye" to run the projects as Docker containers and simulate a microservice architecture. There are only a few slides used for the introduction. The rest of the time will be spent in the code to see how more complex solutions can be developed using Blazor.

This talk is rated level 300 with a target audience of software developers.

It is assumed, that you have basic knowledge of software development with ASP.NET Core. Basic Blazor knowledge is a plus, but not strictly needed.
The code is written in C# and should be accessible to most programmers.
