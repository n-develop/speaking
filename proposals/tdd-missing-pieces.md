Learning Test-Driven Development (TDD) is hard. There, I said it!
But why is hard? And what can you do to make TDD less frustrating to learn/use?

In this talk, you will get to know the "missing pieces" of most TDD introductions. You will learn why "red - green - refactor" isn't enough
and how dependency injection and other techniques will help you write testable code. All code samples are written in C#.

This talk is rated level 200-300 with a target audience of software developers.

It is assumed, that you have working knowledge of software development and a basic understanding of unit testing. 
Code samples are written in C# and should be accessible to most programmers.
